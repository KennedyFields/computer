echo "-----------------------------#1"
#1) (3 points ) Microsft is awesome! True or False? Add a command line parameter to the script
# with which a user running the script can input their answer.  Output the value
# of this parameter to the screen with the format:
# Microsoft is awesome=<your answer>  
# Hint: Don't make this too hard.  Just create a command line parameter and echo the result as above.

#read -p "Microsoft is awesome= "  mic
#echo $mic

#1B) (1 point) Now show the command you would use to run this script with your answer to this question:

#microsoft is awesome=false

echo "-----------------------------#2"
#2) (2 points ) Prompt the user running the script for the value of an additional input parameter. 
# The prompt should say "enter a comfortable outdoor temperature." Call the vairable 'comfy_temp'.  
# Output their answer to the screen in the format: "Comfy Temp=<the answer>"
#BTW once you have a solution for this problem then use file input redirection to answer this question:
# echo 70 > comfytemp.txt
#./test.sh < comfytemp.txt

read -p "enter a comfortable outdoor temperature "  comfy_temp
echo "comfy temp = $comfy_temp"

echo "-----------------------------#3"
#3) (5 points ) Construct if then else logic that will test $comfy_temp your YOUR personal outdoor 
# temperature comfort range.  Indicate if $comfy_temp is 'too cold,' or 'too hot' or 'just right' 
# for you personally. Output that answer to the screen.  Think Goldie Locks here and use Fahrenheit:)

if [ $comfy_temp -gt 85 ]
  then echo "too hot"
elif [ $comfy_temp -lt 70 ] 
  then echo "too cold"
 else echo "just right"
fi

echo "-----------------------------#4"
#4) (5 points) Construct a 'for' loop that begins at the lowest temp in your outdoor temperature comfort range
# and ends at the highest temp. Inside this 'for' loop convert each number (or temperature) from 
# Fahrenheit to Celsius with this formula and echo the results to the screen:
# echo $(echo "scale=2;(5/9)*($F -32)"|bc)
# Note that you replace $F with your loop variable

for F in 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85
do
echo $(echo "scale=2;(5/9)*($F -32)"|bc)
done

echo "-----------------------------#5"
#5) (5 points) Now do the very same thing except call a function from the for loop
# to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. define the function below and put the 
# for loop to call it after that.  

function farenheit {
echo $(echo "scale=2;(5/9)*($F -32)"|bc)
}

for F in 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85
do farenheit $F
done

echo "-----------------------------#6"
#6) (3 points) Construct an array with the range of your comfortable outdoor temperatures.  
# Call it 'mytemprange and echo the entire contents out to the screen - Hint: that should 
# be done with a single echo statement.

mytemprange=(70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85)
echo ${mytemprange[@]}

echo "-----------------------------#7"
#7) (4 points) Calculate the sum of all the numbers in mytemprange and echo it to the screen with 
# the format: "Sum of mytemprange=<sum of numbers in mytemprange>". Hint: use the array from the previous
# quesiton.  

#echo mytemprange = $((70 + 71 + 72 + 73 + 74 + 75 + 76 + 77 + 78 + 79 + 80 + 81 + 82 + 83 + 84 + 85))

echo "-----------------------------#8"
#8) (3 points) Now calculate the average of that temperature range and output it to the scree with the 
# format: "Average of mytemprange=<average of numbers in mytemprange>". Hint: use the sum from the previous
# question.  

echo $((1240 / 15))

echo "-----------------------------#9"
#9) (4 points) From the weather.sample.json file, use jq to pull out the time of 'sunset' and output it
# to the screen in the format: "sunset epoch time: <epoch time from file>"  
# Note: it is in epoch time format

cat weather.sample.json | jq '.dt

echo "-----------------------------#10"
#10) (5 points) Now convert that time to a time format we all can understand and use file 
# redirection to put the converted date/time in a file called ~/tmp/sunset.txt.

#10B (1 point) Now display the contents of ~/tmp/sunset.txt to the screen

echo "-----------------------------#11"
#11) (3 points) Be sure you have moved this file to your git repo and push it to git

#you're done!
